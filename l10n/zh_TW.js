    "Secrets allows users to generate share links for text based data (e.g. passwords, CSV lists, bank accounts...) that can be sent to anyone (including receivers without a Nextcloud account) for retrieval. The data itself will be end-to-end encrypted (so not even Nextcloud can access it) and the encryption key will be part of the share link (the anchor part) - but never be actually sent to the server. Once retrieved, the secret will be deleted from the server, ensuring, that if it arrived at the correct receiver it has been seen by nobody else.\n\nSecrets now comes with a cli that can be used to automate the provisioning of secret shares: https://github.com/theCalcaholic/nextcloud-secrets/releases" : "Secrets 讓使用者可以為以文字為基礎的資料（例如密碼、CSV 清單、銀行帳戶……）產生分享連結，這些連結可以傳送給任何人（包含沒有 Nextcloud 帳號的收件者）以供檢索。資料本身將進行端對端加密（因此即使是 Nextcloud 也無法存取它），並且加密金鑰將成為分享連結的一部分（錨點部分），但永遠不會真正傳送到伺服器。一旦揭露，該秘密將從伺服器中刪除，確保它到達正確的收件者時不會被其他人看到。\n\nSecrets 現在包含了命令列介面，可用於自動設定秘密分享：https://github.com/theCalcaholic/nextcloud-secrets/releases",
